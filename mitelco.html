  <p>
    Mercer Island Telecom, a B2B digital transformation strategy consulting firm, currently needs a website as a platform for information presentation.

        <li> Need more organic traffic</li>
      </ul>

  <h4>Result</h4>
  <p>Mercer Island Telecom needs not only the website, but also the clear and reliable business strategy. First, it needs to ensure the target clients on each email compaign with the specific solution, and simply the user flow. My responsibility is to design the wireframe, and developing it on WordPress. Besides,in order to attract more visitors, I work with marketing department on the email compaign strategy and the SEO optimization.

    <p>
    While comparing these two companies, I notice that both of them have more than one solutions(softwares) for clients to choose. Unlike them, Mercer Island Telecom only focus on Google Suite, especially G Suite essentials to help companies solve the online collaboration working solution. Besides, their business mode is a bit different. Although both of them offer customize solution service, Cloudbaker created many basic solutions in advance which clients can preview and select. Cloudreach still prefer clients contact them and provide the company's information before getting any advice.
    <strong>After the discussion, the manager decided to follow Cloudreach's business mode.</strong>
    
</p>
  <br><br><br><br>
  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <p>Cloudreach is a big company which already have stable volume and authority, but Mercer Island Telecom is not on that stage. Thus I need to figure our Mercer Island Telecom's SWOT. After the long time research, I did the SWOT analysis and presented to my manager.<br><br></p>
  
  <div class="image-sm">

    <p><strong>What are our goals?</strong>- Sell G Suite Essentials to target group.</p>
    <p><strong>Who are our users? </strong>- (B2B) local company who is interested in digital transformation</p>
    <p><strong>What are their needs?</strong> - Digital transformation/ remote work</p>
    <p><strong>What is our value proposition?</strong>-Since Google Cloud is the only solution Mercer Island Telecom prefers, we would provide provide the product information in details on website and customize our service. </p>

  <h3>Wireframe</h3>
  
  <p>Based on the userflow, I create the wireframe by balsamiq.Besides the basic function (lessons,community, store and account) and leaderboard, I also create the interface which collects user's fittness need and exercise level to better recommend apropriate lessons after they sign up.

    The interactive wireframe is made as the rough prototype to test and improve before the high-fidelity prototype is designed.After testing, I found some UX problems exist in the wireframe, the first one is :the "forgot the password" and "set new one" are together in one page, that is too much for mobile users.

  <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
  <p>As a individual project, here is still a lot more to explore with Fitt, including the high-fidelity prototype. Besides, the questions like What if friends were be automatically added by the people nearby or the company's employee? What if Fitt's lessons were generated by users? Can we have more functions like timer and health test? These are just some of the questions I'd like to expand on as I continue to work on this project. I am still continuing the high-fidelity prototype, feel free to check out the current state of the app below. (If the image in prototype does not show up, please change the browser and try again.)</p>
