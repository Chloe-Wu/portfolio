  <div class="other-sm flex">
    <div class="col-40 padding-20">
      <img src="/assets/img/backme/p4.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="col-60 text-left">

        <li> Unclear content strategy</li>
        <li> Need more organic traffic</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h4>Result</h4>
  <p>Mercer Island Telecom needs not only the website, but also the clear and reliable business strategy. First, it needs to ensure the target clients on each email compaign with the specific solution, and simply the user flow. My responsibility is to design the wireframe, and developing it on WordPress. Besides,in order to attract more visitors, I work with marketing department on the email compaign strategy and the SEO optimization.

  <h3>Competitive research</h3>
  <h4>competitors</h4>

    <img src="images/cloudreach.png" alt="">
  </div>
    <p><strong>Cloudbakers</strong>-a cloud solutions and change management partner，it optimizes clients business with the latest cloud technology—it makes implementing clients’ cloud setup an enjoyable process  by providing ongoing support, guidance and plenty of personality at every stage of clients’ transformation.<br><br></p>

  </div>
   <br>  <br>  <br>
    <p>
    While comparing these two companies, I notice that both of them have more than one solutions(softwares) for clients to choose. Unlike them, Mercer Island Telecom only focus on Google Suite, especially G Suite essentials to help companies solve the online collaboration working solution. Besides, their business mode is a bit different. Although both of them offer customize solution service, Cloudbaker created many basic solutions in advance which clients can preview and select. Cloudreach still prefer clients contact them and provide the company's information before getting any advice.
    <strong>After the discussion, the manager decided to follow Cloudreach's business mode.</strong>
    
</p>
  <br><br><br><br>
  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <p>Cloudreach is a big company which already have stable volume and authority, but Mercer Island Telecom is not on that stage. Thus I need to figure our Mercer Island Telecom's SWOT. After the long time research, I did the SWOT analysis and presented to my manager.<br><br></p>

          <p><strong>Mindmap</strong><p>

    <h3>Sitemap (Phase 1)</span></h3>

      <div class="image-md">
    <img src="images/sitemap.png" alt="" width=500px>
  </div>
    <p>Based on the discussion with other team members, I create the website sitemap which includes the minimum viable feature.</p>
  
  <br><br><br>
  <h3>Wireframe</h3>
           <p>According to the sitemap and my team members comments, I design the wireframe of the website iteratively.</p>
        <div class="image-md">
    <img src="images/wireframe3.png" alt="" width=100%>
  </div>

  
  <br><br><br>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <h4>Tools</h4>
  <div class="image-md">
    <img src="images/godaddy.png" alt="" style="width:20%">
    <img src="images/wordpress.png" alt=""style="width:20%">
  </div>
     <br><br><br>
    <h4>Theme</h4>
    <div class="image-md">
    <img src="images/wordpress3.png" alt="">
  </div>
             <p>The website domain was bought by Mr.Carlos Obando,the company CEO. After setting up the domain, we finally decide to use WordPress as our CMS. Carlos prefer to have the easy-editting website. And I recommended him to use the Divi theme. Its css/html5 editting module is easy for me to use, and its visual editting function would be friendly to my non technical collegues.</p>
  <br><br><br>
  <p>
  </p>
  <br><br><br>
      <h3>SEO</h3>
  <div class="image-md">
    <img src="images/seo.png" alt="">
  </div>
    <p>The SEO strategy I chose are: keyword research and backlink research. For example, I created keyword lists including general producti and service idea and competitors keywords. And rank them by volume and keyword difficulty. The backlink research would be focusing on both "follow" and "non follow" which can be checked from source code. Since I added the Google Analytic tracking code into the website 3 month ago, traffic has been increased 346.3%.</p>
  <br><br><br>
   <h3>Update Info</h3>
  <p>
The website development is not finished since Google updated its G Suite Essential product to be Google Workspace last month. To avoid unnecessary risk, the company's next step will focus on writing the new content.
