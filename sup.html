  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <br><br>

    <p>Plastics have become a severe transboundary threat to natural ecosystems and human health, with studies predicting a twofold increase in the number of plastic debris by 2030. <br><br>However, such predictions will likely be aggravated by the <b>excessive use and consumption of single-use plastics</b> due to COVID-19 pandemic. People were required to self-quarantine, avoid physical contact with others, and maintain social distance. That led to a dramatic increase in the food delivery industry. It seems that the pandemic goes smoother after S2 2021. <br><br>According to a recentsurvey conducted by Cowen&Co., <b>52% of 2500 customers said they would avoid restaurants and bars even after they fully reopen.</b> That’s also contributing to the huge increase in the food-delivery industry.

        <br><br>After our research online, we found that <b>a typical Chinese food to-go package would include more disposable plastic service items(e.g. plastic bags, plastic clamshells, condiment packets, and utensilsets)</b> when compared to other types of food. And we would like to dive deeper into this problem and hopefully find practical solutions to decrease the amount of SUP usage in Chinese restaurants.</p>

    <section style="padding:5% 0%;float:left;margin:0% 15%;">
<div style="width:30%;float:left"><h4>Secondary Research</h4></div>
        <div style="width:70%;float:left"><p>According to a survey conducted on the U.S. consumers, we found that 60 to 70 percent of consumers said they would pay more for sustainable packaging. A willingness to pay more was relatively equally distributed across end-use segments. In addition, Fifty-two percent of consumers said they would buy more products with sustainable packaging if those products didn’t cost more than conventionally packaged ones. We  realized that consumers are willing to pay more for green, but they would also buy additional sustainably packaged products if more of them were available and they were better labeled. The COVID-19 crisis has significantly heightened consumer sensitivity to hygiene and food safety,  These findings drove us to think more about the possibility of business direction.</p></div>

    <section style="padding:5% 0%;float:left;margin:0% 15%;">
<div style="width:70%;float:left"><p>We went to three Chinese restaurants, and observed them for at least thirty minutes to get more realistic data on plastic use and user behavior. Overall, the most used SUPs in Chinese restaurants are plastic boxes and bowls of different sizes, plastic cups, plastic sauce boxes, and plastic cutlery. Commonly people who pick up take-away food on-site are not offered the option to choose whether or not to have cutlery. However, this option is available on most online delivery platforms. We also found that consumers sometimes ask for more or larger bags or for packaging to pack leftovers from in-store meals. To be surprised, all restaurants we observed do not have any information about recycling or reusing in the pick-up area, nor signs showing any eco-friendly suggestions. And I also heard some customers complaining about that the restaurant distributed utensils improperly.</p></div>

    <div style="width:20%;float:left"><h4>Survey</h4></div>
<div style="width:80%;float:left"><p>
In order to validate our findings and expand upon ideas, we invited 27 people to fill the survey regarding Single-use Plastic Packages of Chinese restaurants in both dine-in and take-away scenarios. Only a few people said they used to get the advice about not using plastic utensils from restaurants when they order take-away food.Some people would like to order food without getting the disposable utensils if the restaurant offered a discount. And some customers are willing to pay extra 50 cents if the restaurant's utensils are made from environmental protection material.
It is worth to mention, almost half of our participants think wrong that SUP utensils are much safer than reusable utensils in terms of COVID-19 protection, and another one-fourth of customers said they don’t know the answer. And few people used to notice the signs in support of recycle/reuse/reduce and environmental protections in the restaurant. It means that most small or middle size Chinese restaurants in the Seattle area either don’t have environmental protection signs or their environmental protection signs are invisible.</p></div>
