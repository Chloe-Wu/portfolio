    <p>Most calculus education creates <b>fixed mindsets</b>, as the essential STEM major subject, many students gave up learning calculus because they have the bias that calculus is boring, difficult and useless. Under covid-19, <b>the zoom-based calculus learning class, and the limited office hours makes more complaints.</b> <br><br>

      Our team focused on how to effectively use mobile application to help students who learn calculus or someone who is interested in calculus learn <b>efficiently and continuously.</b><br><br></p>

  <h2>Research</h2>
    <br><br>
  <h4>
      The top reasons respondents lacked a motivation of learning calculus were that the curriculum was too boring to insist, and too hard to learn by themselves under covid-19.</h4>
    <br>

  <p>We interviewed 15 participants to gather insights about their calculus learning habits, satisfication, and complaints. </p>
  <br>
      <h4 style="text-align: center">Are you satisfied with your current calculus learning? </h4>
    <br>
  <div class="image-sm">
    <img src="images/interview1.svg" alt="">
  </div><br><br>
<h4 style="text-align: center">What features or functions would your ideal calculus learning app have?</h4><br>
      <div class="image-sm">
    <img src="images/interview2.svg" alt="">
  </div><br><br>    <p>Many people are not satisfied with textbook, their teachers and current online resources. <p><h4>The zoom-based calculus education makes the learning hard because people feel lonely, have difficulty communicating and concentrating.<br></h4>
    
   <p>For our first prototype, because a lot of people for existing calculus teaching materials and teaching methods, wants to increase the visual and interactive, so the team's first idea is to create a AR calculus products to revolutionize the traditional calculus teaching, we studied the mobile AR technology level and now want to be able to enhance the user interest of learning.
</p><br>
    
    <section style="color:white;background-size: cover; background-image: url(images/background.svg);padding:5% 10%;float:left;margin:5% 0%;">
    <div style="width:30%;float:left"><h5>VERSION 1:
AR MOBILE APP</h5></div><div style="width:70%;float:left"><h5>By using AR method, the concept of Calculus is presented in 3D graphics, such as the conic section to understand the concept.</h5></div>

    <div style="width:40%;float:left;"><img src=images/geogebra.svg></div>
    <div style="width:60%;float:left"><h4>3D geometry concept</h4><p>After interviews, we figured out that there have already been some apps exist in the current market which help students to understand the calculus concept in some levels, but far away from satisfying them from the interaction and visual perspective. Most two mentioned are Geogebra 3D and Desmos, they both focus on entering functions and show graphics, thus, we designed the app which focuses on the AR geometry to enhance the interaction and graphy. </p></div>
</section>
    
    <section style="padding:5% 10%;float:left;margin:5% 0%;">
<div style="width:40%;float:left"><h4>Simulated AR objects when the conic section and function changed</h4><p>Our team use the Adobe Aero and figma to create the AR prototype. Users can create AR object based on the option of the plane and pyramid, move and rotate them to observe how conic section and function change.</p></div>
            <div style="width:60%;float:left"><img src=images/ARpro.svg></div>
</section>
<p>We formed a usability testing group of 8 from our original interview respondents. Six of them excited with the combinition between the traditional graphics and AR interaction, they claimed that the innovative idea increases their motivation about learning calculus and would like to design different calculus shape. Two respondents still don’t understand the concept after complete the routine.<br><br>

    <div style="width:20%;float:left"><h3>PIVOT</h3></div><div style="width:80%;float:left"><p>However, our team faced difficulty in further product development due to lack of mentorship and experience in calculus content and AR app development.<br><br>

           These limitations and further discussion with the testing group users led us to review another pain point that users had—<b>the frustrations from not having enough professionals and exercises help in improving their calculus level.</b></p></div>
</section>
    <section>
              <h2>Idea Iteration</h2><br>
         <h4>We re-evaluate our insights from interviews and testing, and decided to design a new version based on two highest severity problems.</h4>
        <p>Although AR geometry concept improve the interest of learning calculus, our users still doubt if they would continueously using this innovative product daily. 3 of them complaint that they spending too much time on operating AR objects, that does not fit their needs. They are looking forward the product which can help them for specific problems from their class or homework. <br><br></p>
<br><br>

  <h2>Main User Flow</h2>
   <br>
    <p>This is the main process for <b>interest-driven users</b>, in order to <b>overcome their fear of calculus and increase their interest</b> in learning. For professional calculus users, they need systematic learning, then perhaps the traditional way of education is more suitable. Since this user research is mainly based on interests and <b>does not want to directly spend expensive tuition fees </b>and a lot of time in class, all design decisions will be focused on this user group. 
<br><br>
Future iterations of the product will focus on research and design for users who are interested in STEM majors and want to learn calculus in advance to provide more convenience for future exams and major selection.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2><br>
 <h4>Collaboration</h4>
    <p>Creating a 345pi mobile application is a great opportunity. This was my first big project as a UX/UI designer, and I was honored that my team members were very friendly and responsible. Remote work didn’t make communication difficult for us but gave everyone more freedom and flexibility.</p>

 <h4>Learning Opportunity</h4>
    <p>We used this project to attend UW CoMotion program, I presented our design concept and final prototype in a 6-minite presentation from investors and other start up teams. <b> We passed the NSF program phase II based on the iteration of the prototype.</b> </p>
    
 <h4>Overcoming Doubt</h4>
    <p>I had some doubt throughout this project that maybe users wouldn’t want a place to communicate. They probably just want to get the homework answer asap. However, I overcame that doubtfulness while doing user interviews, many users told me if they only want to have the answer, they will just google search or use Quizlet/Chegg. They don’t want to pay for these products because they don’t really teach them or let them have fun. The result also makes me know that what I thought does not mean what users thought. What we were doing was giving them the option to have a more personalized learning experience by offering a community platform and resources.</p>
